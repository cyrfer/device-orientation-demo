# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository is a demonstration project for device orientation functionality.

## Project Overview

This is a device orientation demo that showcases how to detect and respond to device orientation changes in web applications.

## Code Style and Conventions

- Follow modern JavaScript/ES6+ best practices
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Write concise comments only when necessary to explain complex logic
- Prefer readability over brevity

## Best Practices

- Ensure code is compatible with modern browsers that support device orientation APIs
- Handle device orientation permission requests appropriately
- Provide clear user feedback for unsupported features or denied permissions
- Test functionality on multiple devices and orientations

## Security Considerations

- Always request user permission before accessing device orientation data
- Handle permission denials gracefully
- Follow secure coding practices for web applications

## Documentation

- Keep README.md updated with clear usage instructions
- Document API changes and feature additions
- Include examples for common use cases
